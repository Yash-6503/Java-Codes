Program 01 :
------------
Create a record called Product which is accepting two components pid and pname.

Write one compact constructor to throw IllegalArgumentException if pid is zero or Negative.

Create one TreeSet class which will hold the Custom product object.

With the help of TreeSet constructor using Comparator interface, write the logic to sort the Product data on the following basis
 
1) Sort based on the pid in ascending order.
2) Sort based on the pid in descending order.
3) Sort based on the name in Alphabetical order.
4) Sort based on the name in Reverse order.

Program 02 :
------------
Create a record called Book which take two components name and author.

Implement this Book record with Comparable interface to sort the books based on the name using compareTo() method.

Create an ELC class BookSorted which will sort the book based on the name.

Create one TreeSet object which will hold Book as a custom object.

Insert 5 book records using custom object.

Display all the books sorted in alphabetial order.
