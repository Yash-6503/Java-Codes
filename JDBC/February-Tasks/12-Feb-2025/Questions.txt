Program_02:
==========
You are tasked with developing a Java application that interacts with a relational database using JDBC. The application needs to perform a series of database operations within a single transaction. Your task is to design and implement a Java program that accomplishes the following:
Connect to a database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) using JDBC.
 
=>create a table and insert records. your table data should represent as below.

Table Name: Employee:
======================
Column name          data type
-----------	    -----------
Id		     number(8)
name		     varchar2(20)
age		     number(3)
salary		     number(8,2)

Employee Data:
==============
1	Naresh	22	23432.6
2	Suresh	23	32222.5
3	Jain	32	43332.6
4	David	27	15009.2
5	Anthony	34	32322.5

Create Employee class:
======================
instance variables:
-------------------
int id;
String name;
int age;
double salary;

retrive the data from employee table and store it in list<Employee> objecct;

Get list of employees who are older than 25 years.

Expected output:
---------------- 
3	Jain	32	43332.6
4	David	27	15009.2
5	Anthony	34	32322.5
