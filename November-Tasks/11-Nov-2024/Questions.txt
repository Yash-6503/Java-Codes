Online Shopping System

You are building an Online Shopping System, and you need to create a class hierarchy to represent different types of products that customers can purchase. 
You will be implementing a set of classes that model the products and their attributes. The focus of this problem is to demonstrate the use of inheritance and method overriding in Java.

Follow the provided code as a base, and create the necessary classes to satisfy the requirements below:


  Create a class named Product:

    It should have protected instance variables name (String) and price (double).

    Implement a constructor that initializes the name and price.

    Define a method displayInfo() that prints the product's name and price.

    Define a method calculateTotalCost(int quantity) that calculates and returns the total cost of purchasing a given quantity of the product.



  Create a subclass named Electronics:

    Extend the Product class.

    Add a private instance variable brand (String).

    Implement a constructor that takes name, price, and brand as parameters and initializes the superclass constructor.

    Define a method displayInfo() method to additionally print the product's brand.



  Create another subclass named Clothing:

    Extend the Product class.

    Add a private instance variable size (String).

    Implement a constructor that takes name, price, and size as parameters and initializes the superclass constructor.

    Define a method displayInfo() method to additionally print the product's size.



  Create a class named OnlineShopping (as provided in the code):

    In the main method, create instances of both Electronics and Clothing with appropriate values.

    Print information about each product, including their specific attributes.

    Calculate and print the total cost for a given quantity of each product.



Your task is to implement the required classes based on the provided problem description. This will help you practice inheritance concepts.

Problem Statement: Sport Motorcycle Inheritance System
You are asked to implement a multilevel inheritance system for a hierarchy of vehicles, specifically focusing on motorcycles. 
This system will include basic vehicle information, general motorcycle features, and specific properties for sport motorcycles. 
Follow the requirements below to design and implement this system.

Requirements
Vehicle Class (Grandparent Class)

Create a class named Vehicle with the following attributes:
brand (String): The brand of the vehicle.
year (int): The year the vehicle was manufactured.
Constructor:
Vehicle(String brand, int year): Initializes the brand and year of the vehicle.
Method:
void displayVehicleDetails(): Displays the vehicleâ€™s brand and year.
Motorcycle Class (Parent Class)

Create a class named Motorcycle that inherits from Vehicle.
Additional attribute:
engineCapacity (int): Engine capacity of the motorcycle in cubic centimeters (cc).
Constructor:
Motorcycle(String brand, int year, int engineCapacity): Initializes the brand, year, and engine capacity of the motorcycle.
Method:
void startEngine(): Displays a message indicating the engine is starting, showing the engine capacity.
SportMotorcycle Class (Child Class)

Create a class named SportMotorcycle that inherits from Motorcycle.
Additional attribute:
raceMode (boolean): Indicates if race mode is activated for the sport motorcycle.
Constructor:
SportMotorcycle(String brand, int year, int engineCapacity, boolean raceMode): Initializes the brand, year, engine capacity, and race mode status of the sport motorcycle.
Methods:
void activateRaceMode(): Activates race mode and displays a message confirming that race mode is now on.
void displaySportMotorcycleDetails(): Displays the full details of the sport motorcycle, including brand, year, engine capacity, and the status of race mode.
Main Class (MotorcycleInheritanceExample)

In the main class, create an instance of SportMotorcycle with the following details:
Brand: "Ducati"
Year: 2023
Engine Capacity: 1200 cc
Race Mode: Initially set to false.
Perform the following actions in the main method:
Start the engine.
Activate the race mode.
Display all details of the sport motorcycle.
